    &lt;h1>JSP 2.0 Examples - Repeat SimpleTag Handler&lt;/h1>
    &lt;hr>
    &lt;p>This tag handler accepts a "num" parameter and repeats the body of the
    tag "num" times.  It's a simple example, but the implementation of
    such a tag in JSP 2.0 is substantially simpler than the equivalent
    JSP 1.2-style classic tag handler.&lt;/p>
    &lt;p>The body of the tag is encapsulated in a "JSP Fragment" and passed
    to the tag handler, which then executes it five times, inside a
    for loop.  The tag handler passes in the current invocation in a
    scoped variable called count, which can be accessed using the EL.&lt;/p>
    &lt;br>
    &lt;b>&lt;u>Result:&lt;/u>&lt;/b>&lt;br>
    &lt;mytag:repeat num="5">
      Invocation ${count} of 5&lt;br>
    &lt;/mytag:repeat>
  &lt;/body>
&lt;/html>
