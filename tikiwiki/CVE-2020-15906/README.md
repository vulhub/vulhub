There is a new vulnerability in TikiWiki Cms Groupware 16.x - 21.1. It allows remote unauthenticated attackers to bypass the login page which results in a full compromise of Tiki Wiki CMS. An Attacker is able to bruteforce the Admin account until it is locked. After that an empty Password can be used to authenticate as admin to get access.
