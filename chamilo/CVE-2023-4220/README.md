# CVE-2023-4220


Chamilo LMS is a free software e-learning and content management system. In versions prior to <= v1.11.24
a webshell can be uploaded via the bigload.php endpoint. If the GET request parameter `action` is set to
`post-unsupported` file extension checks are skipped allowing for attacker controlled .php files to be uploaded to:
`/main/inc/lib/javascript/bigupload/files/` if the `/files/` directory already exists - it does not exist by default.
The required directory `/files`/ has been added to this container for vulnerability testing purposes.

This docker setup was entirely copied from https://github.com/22phuber/docker-compose-chamilo-lms. The original Dockerfile
had the Chamilo version set to 1.11.12 which is unaffected by the vulnerability as it doesn't have the /bigupload/ endpoint.
The base version of PHP was updated, as well as some necessary packages to prevent the build from failling. The version of
Chamilo was updated to 1.11.18 which is affected by CVE-2023-4220 also as mentioned the necessary dierctory `/files/` has
been added as well. Thanks to 22phuber for all the hard work.


## Chamilo LMS docker-compose


A simple docker-compose setup for [Chamilo](https://chamilo.org/) LMS.

Official Docker Hub images used:


* [php](https://hub.docker.com/_/php/) (7.x-apache)
* [mariadb](https://hub.docker.com/_/mariadb/) (latest)


Chamilo LMS on Github: https://github.com/chamilo/chamilo-lms

This setup doesn't directly install/configure Chamilo. You have to use the Chamilo installation wizard once the docker containers are up.

*This setup works with Chamilo version 1.11.x*


### Optional Host system config


On the Host system you need to add a `/etc/hosts` entry for the domain name configured in the apache vhost:


```bash
sudo echo "127.0.0.1 docker.chamilo.net" >> /etc/hosts
```


#### `.../etc/hosts` on Windows


* Open a text editor as administrator (with administrator privileges)
* Open hosts file: `C:\Windows\System32\Drivers\etc\hosts`
* Add entry `127.0.0.1 docker.chamilo.net` at the end of the file and **save**.


## ENV Variables


### `environment` variables for MYSQL


You can define mysql username, password and database name in the docker-compose config:


```yaml
    ...
    environment:
      - MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=pass
      - MYSQL_USER=chamilo
      - MYSQL_PASSWORD=chamilo
      - MYSQL_DATABASE=chamilo
    ...
```


### `args` variables for building Chamilo


You can define the Version for Chamilo with `CHAMILO_VERSION`.
And you have to set the `CHAMILO_TAR` filename due to incosistent naming.
Check for `.tar.gz` filenames here: https://github.com/chamilo/chamilo-lms/releases

Example in `docker-compose.yml`:
```yaml
      args:
        - CHAMILO_VERSION=1.11.10
        - CHAMILO_TAR=chamilo-1.11.10-php7.3.tar.gz
```

The `args` settings in `docker-compose.yml` will override the `ARG` settings in the `Dockerfile`.
If you remove the `args` in `docker-compose.yml`, the "fallback" values from the `Dockerfile` will be used.


### Build & Run


#### Build


Build chamilo docker image

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml build
```


#### Run


```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml up
```


## Database connection step in web installation wizard


The "Database Host" in step 4 of the mysql connections settings has to be the name of the docker image defined in the appropriate `docker-compose.yml`.

Database Host: `mariadb`


## Access Chamilo Website


Access Chamilo URL with `/etc/hosts` entry:


```
http://docker.chamilo.net:8080/
```


Without `/etc/hosts` entry:


```
http://localhost:8080
```
